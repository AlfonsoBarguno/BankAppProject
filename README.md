This is an <strong>Java application</strong>, made with <strong>SpringBoot</strong> and a <strong>relational database (SQL)</strong>. 
Includes a <strong>basic security process</strong> and currently I'm working in the <strong>unit and integration tests</strong>.

You can access either as an Admin or as a User, create an Account Holder or a Third Party user, and chose between four types of accounts. 
The system is able to modify accounts, make transfers, apply interest rates and penalty fees.
